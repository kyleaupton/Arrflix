# What Is Arrflix?

## Introduction

Arrflix is an **early-stage**, **open source project** that aims to simplify personal media automation.

It exists because setting up and maintaining a media automation stack today is often **brittle, time-consuming, and harder than it needs to be**. Many existing solutions work well once they’re running, but getting there usually involves stitching together multiple services, learning their quirks, and hoping they continue to behave the way you expect.

Arrflix is an attempt to make that whole process simpler, more consistent, and easier to reason about.

## Status & Expectations

Arrflix is:

- Actively evolving
- Opinionated
- Incomplete
- Experimental
- Documentation will lag behind implementation.
- Breaking changes will happen.
- Features may be redesigned or removed.

This project exists because the author wanted something better—and clearer—than what currently exists. If it becomes useful to others along the way, that’s a win.

## Who This Is For

Arrflix is for people who:

- Want a simpler setup
- Are frustrated by fragile or over-complicated configurations
- Don’t mind experimenting with unfinished software

If you need something stable and fully polished today, Arrflix probably isn’t the right choice yet. If you’re interested in a more straightforward approach and don’t mind early-stage software, you’re welcome to follow along or contribute.
